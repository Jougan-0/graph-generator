# Smart Contract Visualizer

## Overview
This project provides an interactive visualization tool for smart contracts. Users can input a smart contract, process it through an LLM model via Lumo Labs, and generate a structured, interactive graph representation of the contract's logic and structure.

## Workflow
The project follows these steps:

1. **User Inputs the Smart Contract**  
   - Users provide the smart contract code to be analyzed.

2. **Model Selection via Lumo Labs**  
   - The user selects a specific LLM model from Lumo Labs to process the contract.

3. **LLM Model Generates a Structured Response**  
   - The selected model processes the input and generates a structured response based on predefined patterns.

4. **Parsing & Data Extraction**  
   - A parser extracts key information from the model's response and formats it for visualization.

5. **Interactive Graph Generation**  
   - The UI interprets the structured data and generates an interactive graph for easy contract visualization and analysis.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Input:** Accepts smart contract code from the user.
- **LLM Processing:** Uses an LLM model for code analysis and structuring.
- **Parsing Engine:** Extracts relevant details for better visualization.
- **Interactive UI:** Generates a graph-based representation of the contract logic.
